# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-CSE475

- We built an ML project which recognizes digit (0 to 9) individually which should write on the screen by touch screen or mouse and the program takes a screenshot of that space and then try to recognize it. We got a good accuracy score.

- **Technologies:** Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, many python libraries, ML etc.
